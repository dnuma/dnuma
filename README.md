Hey, I'm @dnuma, Colombian by birth and residing in Canada. After 15 years working in areas that did not complement me, today I can finally say that I am 100% happy in what I do.
I'm studying Computer Application Development at Conestoga College, falling in love with backend development.
Starting your professional life from scratch, one more time, has never felt so good.
