Hey, I'm @dnuma, Colombian by birth and residing in Canada. After 15 years working in areas that did not complement me, today I can finally say that I am 100% happy in what I do.
I am studying Computer Application Development at Conestoga College and I'm fascinated with C # and JavaScript.
Starting your professional life from scratch has never felt so good.
