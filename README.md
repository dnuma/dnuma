Meet David, a Senior QA Automation Engineer who absolutely loves what he does. He’s got a real knack for TypeScript—and an even greater knack for spotting those sneaky bugs that somehow slip past everyone else. Whether it’s frontend, backend, or deep API layers, David’s all about making sure software is rock-solid, reliable, and ready to roll.

He’s a Playwright powerhouse, having built multiple frameworks from scratch across web, mobile, and API layers. He’s wired for fast-paced environments, thrives on collaboration, and has a sixth sense for catching issues before they become problems. From syncing PowerShell scripts for DB manipulation to crafting one-click TestRail magic, David’s the kind of engineer who turns chaos into clean, scalable automation.

But David’s not just about squashing bugs—he’s passionate about building software people actually enjoy using. He’s a lifelong learner, always diving into new tech, refining his workflows, and leveling up his craft. He’s fluent in English and Spanish, and works independently like a pro in remote setups.

When he’s not automating the universe, you’ll find David hanging out with his family, adventuring with his dogs, tuning into a podcast or audiobook, or geeking out over Star Wars lore. And yes, he still asks an LLM to write about himself in the third person—because why not?
